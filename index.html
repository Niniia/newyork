<p class="webtext">Traveling is a very crucial part of life as it is the best way to get out of the busy schedule. It is also to experience life in different ways .Traveling is actually a good remedy for stress, anxiety and depression. It also improves the mental and physical health. We only have one life and we should thank it for making us more advanced creature on this planet. Not only do we get to experience the beauty of nature, different geographies ,topographies, and people. Traveling is all about exploring new places, cultures, cuisines, rituals and styles of living. We also travel because distance and difference are the secret toxic of learning and creativity which one cannot observe by sitting at home. Traveling in itself has advantages, as it makes one forget his or her worries, problems, frustrations and fears. This helps by broadening your horizon to move in new directions, unplugging from the pulls and pushes of daily life. We have a passport to fill full of stamps rather  than to have a house full of stuff. Letâ€™s use this to make memories all over the world</p><br>

		<h2>Benefits of traveling:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Improves your health</strong></li>
			<p>From cutting down on stress, to lowering your chances of developing a heart disease, the health benefits of traveling are huge. You may stay sitting on a chair all day long at the workplace: including some walking to your trip is sure to make your body feel better. For some people, wandering abroad is even a cure for depression and anxiety. Of course, it's not a foolproof cure, but it might help you feel better, both physically and psychologically.</p>
		<li><strong>Lets you disconnect from your daily life</strong></li>
			<p>We tend to get so caught up in our daily lives that sometimes, by simply sticking around, we may do ourselves more harm than good. Sometimes it is best to take a step back, take a deep breath and go take that Tower Bridge selfie. In all seriousness, traveling is not a bad option - it is the most natural way of inducing the feeling you miss someone or that you are missed.</p>
		<li><strong>Improves your understanding of other cultures</strong></li>
			<p>Why we travel may differ from one person to another, but people traveling always develop empathy and a deeper understanding of other cultures. Being more understanding and tolerant about a culture different than ours is part of being smarter, but I consider it as a benefits of traveling in itself.</p>
		<li><strong>Makes you more interesting</strong></li>
			<p>I have no doubt that you're quite the conversationalist. That being said, including a few stories from abroad is likely to grant you even more attention. Mentioning something that most people aren't familiar with or bring a new perspective is always a good way to shine in a social situation. No need to write a whole travel essay, just discuss what you've seen and where you've been: people who are accustomed to their daily life will travel with your words.</p>
		<li><strong>Lets you create lifetime memories</strong></li>
			<p>No matter how insignificant it may seem, the fact that you've had an experience abroad, something that was out of the ordinary, creates a memory that you will remember for a long time and in the end memories are all we have. </p>
